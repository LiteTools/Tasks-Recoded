**Tasks** is an application that improves computer performance. **Tasks**'s main features include an advanced cleanup tool, a startup manager, and a detailed Task Manager. These tools help improve computer performance, system boot times, and ensures a safer experience while using your computer.

### Intentions
We aim to make a lightweight, free, intuitive and responsive cleaning tool. We believe that computer performance is crucial to everyone and should not include any hidden paywalls inside the application. Our goal is to make a tool that anyone can use from anywhere.

## Features

- Cleanup:
  - Quick Clean to help optimize folders that get filled fast.
  - Extension removal tool to remove malicious or unwanted extensions. (Supports Edge, Chrome, and Firefox)
  - Advanced cleaning tool that helps with computer performance and speed.
  - Diverse support for multiple applications and browsers and unneeded system cache. (Chrome, Discord, Temp, and more.)

- Startup Manager:
  - View detailed information about programs that run on start. (Name, Description, Directory)
  - Create new programs that run on start.
  - Remove malicious programs that run on start with one click.
  - View detailed information about services that run on start. (Name, Service, Stopped or Running)
  - Open the startup folder with one click.
  - Clean and understandable interface to see all startup processes and services.

- Task Manager:
  - Advanced task manager with more details. (Name, PID, CPU Usage, Directory)
  - Create new tasks easily with a familiar interface.
  - Quickly end tasks with one button.
  - Refresh Task Manager with one button.
  - Clean and understandable interface to see running processes.
  
- Settings:
  - Ability to change the theme of Tasks. (Dark / Light Mode)
  - Toggle the ability to turn on or off cleanup logs.
  - Change general settings about Tasks.
  - Change the language of Tasks. (WIP)
