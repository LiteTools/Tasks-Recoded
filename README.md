  - View detailed information about programs that run on start. (Name, Description, Directory)
  - Create new programs that run on start.
  - Remove malicious programs that run on start with one click.
  - View detailed information about services that run on start. (Name, Service, Stopped or Running)
  - Open the startup folder.
